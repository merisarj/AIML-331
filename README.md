# AIML331 Assignment 1

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation for Assignment 1 of AIML331. The assignment focuses on image processing and filtering techniques.

## Checkerboard Problem 
- **2.1:** Finding and converting a checkerboard image to grayscale
- **2.2:** Computing image histogram and cumulative probability function
- **2.3:** Implementing low-pass filtering in the spatial domain
- **2.4:** Analysis of filter separability
- **2.5:** Implementing the same low-pass filter in the frequency domain
- **2.6:** Computing the histogram of the filtered image
- **2.7:** Using cumulative distribution functions to achieve uniform intensity distribution

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy - for all calculations, PIL - for image file handling, matplotlip - plotting histograms and displaying images

## Implementation Notes
- I have used generative AI - ChatGPT for some visualisation and histogram calculations
- The checkerboard processing uses a gaussian filter for low-pass filtering
- The implementation minimizes external library dependencies

## Report
The accompanying pdf contains:
- Detailed explanation of all implemented solutions
- Visualization of histograms and processing results
